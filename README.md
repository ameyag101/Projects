This repository stores Jupyter notebook PDF files of short projects, assignments, and exercises I have completed related to a variety of ML related technologies and techniques for my future reference. Projects exist in the following categories:

- Big data tools coursework (Cassandra, MongoDB, SQL, Spark, Neo4j)

- Traditional ML algorithms (PCA, Neural Nets, Random forests)

- Labs on prompt engineering and fine-tuning LLMs (from Andrew Ng's Gen AI course)

- Classification exercise using BERT

- A simple RAG pipeline using Gemini LLM api

- Exercises with the JAX library


**FILE DESCRIPTION**

- **AudioClustering**: Goal was to extract features from 90 audio files, perform dimension reduction using
                 Principal Component Analysis, and cluster the files using KMeans.


- **BERT_classification**: Given annotated csv dataset on recorded classroom student discussions in English Literature class, goal was to leverage BERT and classify discussions into various collaboration codes. 

- **CassandraExercises**: Apache Cassandra exercises and analysis.

- **Iris_NN_exercise**: Aimed to perform multi-class classification on the Iris dataset using a simple
feedforward neural network.

- **JAXexercise**: JAX is library commonly used for array-based numerical computation - performed exercises with this library to understand how it works and its benefits.

- **Lab_finetune_gen_ai_model**: From Andrew Ng's Gen AI course - goal was to test methods for finetuning language models.

- **Lab_summarize_dialogue**: From Andrew Ng's Gen AI course - goal was to understand prompt engineering language models, particulary with the task of summarizing dialogues.

- **MongoDBexercises**: MongoDB querying exercises.

- **NN_loan_exercise**: Using Kaggle's dataset on bank loan approval, aimed to build loan approval prediction model using neural network.

- **Neo4jexercises**: Exercise with graph database queries.

- **RAG_code_partial**: Jupyter notebook from group capstone project. Given project description documents (PDD) from Verra registry on carbon emissions reductions and carbon credits, aimed to build a simple RAG (retrieval augmented generation) pipeline to build a brand new PDD based on new specifications.

- **RandomForest_Loan_exercise**: With Kaggle dataset on bank loan approval, built a loan approval prediction model using random forest.

- **SQLexercises**: SQL querying exercises.

- **SparkExercises** Apache Spark querying exercises.
